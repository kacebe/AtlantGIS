AtlantGIS
=========

Faked GIS-Datasets, simulating an island in the Atlantic for educational purposes in using GIS in archaeology. All AtlantGIS data are published under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 license.

The idea is to create artificial data creatively referring to the story of Atlantis as told by Platon.
We believe that simple datasets with a narrative are most qualified to impart knowledge and skills to students. 

Whoever likes the idea is invited to contribute data using the repository on GitHub. We ask every contributor to link to documents that put the dataset in context of a special GIS-related task and make the tutorials/workshop documents available under an open licence.

DISCLAIMER: These data are not in any way based on any "identification" of Platon's concept of Atlantis in geographical sense. They should and cannot be used to argue in favour or against any scientific of unscientific hypotheses.
